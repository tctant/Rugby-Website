                        <h3>About the Team</h3>
                        <p>
                            We are a club team in the Gold Coast Conference playing both 15's and 7's. We have a Varsity that plays in the D1AA league 
                            and a Junior Varsity team for those still learning the game.
                        </p>
            
                        <h3>What to expect</h3>
                        <p>
                            The fall is our preason, with practice going from early September to early November every Tuesday and Thursday from 6 to 9 pm. We typically play our games 
                            on Saturday but during are occasionally on Fridays. After winter break training start back in January with the regular season running until late March, with
                            the potential for playoffs after that. Practices aren't required, but they are heavily encouraged, especially for those looking to play on the Varsity squad.
                        </p>
